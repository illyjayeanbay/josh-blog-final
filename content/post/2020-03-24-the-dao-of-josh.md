In my favorite book, The Dao of Capital, Mark Spitznagel talks about his roundabout investment philosophy. He uses the California redwoods as an analogy. These conifers grow slowly at first, as they build a foundation that allows them to rise above the canopy and continue to grow for 1000s of years. Their deciduous competitors the angiosperms, on the other hand, start off by growing very quickly. Initially, they are larger, but they do not develop the foundations that would allow them to thrive for centuries like a redwood.  
  
As Tanda heads towards its first decade as a company, we are not interested in unsustainable growth. Instead, we are focused on building a strong foundation that will allow us to become the redwood in our market. As a software company, we believe that the roundabout route is to build a great product that enables our customers to create successful businesses. My role at Tanda is to guide investment into our product that results in long term success for our customers.
