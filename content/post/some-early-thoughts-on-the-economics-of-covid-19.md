I think by far the fairest way of dealing with this crisis is to let employees, businesses, landlords and banks work out for themselves how to keep as much a float as possible. Really the entire private sector is in this together, and I suspect we might be surprised how much different parts of the supply chain could get creative to keep their counterparties in business.  
  
There will still be many businesses that fail. Lets try not to get too sentimental. The best thing to do is to remove the social and legal impacts of insolvency, so that these people can start applying their entrepreneurial skills as quickly as possible.  
  
My biggest concern is that any recovery is going to be slowed substantially by the tax burden left by dropping 10% of GDP on stimulas. For business people this basically becomes an exercise in how to most effectively offload losses to taxpayers.
