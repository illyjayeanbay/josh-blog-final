The word agile gets thrown around a lot these days especially in Software development circles where it’s more or less the universally accepted best practice.

This universal acceptance has not yet reached the software implementation world. I suspect this stems from a very limited discussion about it.

## What is agile?

Agile a broad church of ideas created in the late ’90s to address a big problem in software.

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

**Working software** over comprehensive documentation

**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

**Responding to change** over following a plan

  
Out of this grew a much larger pool of people all over the world using these ideas to deliver value in projects.

## What makes Workforce Management Implementation Fit for Agile?

Many opportunities to start

WFM projects lend themselves to a divide and conquer strategy. Unlike payroll or HRIS projects which often have to cut over in one hit to allow tax balances to be properly transitioned.

WFM can be introduced at the start of any pay period.

**Cohorts**

Workforce management lends itself to be rolled out in cohorts. Finding regions, sites or groups that don’t have interdependencies is not difficult, probably because geographical consideration restrict employee sharing to occur everywhere.

**Limited Feature or Module Dependency**

There are limited interdependencies between key WFM features. Of course everything will be better once schedules can be compared to timesheets in real-time but people can still be paid correctly in most cases without the schedule. This means that it's possible to ease employees and front line managers into the system, module by module. Allowing them to build and learn on skills that are created.

**Rollback Ability**

WFM can be rolled out without throwing the baby out with the bathwater. It’s not difficult to transition to a new system, before completely turning off the system. Even in the most dramatic of situations, the data required to get staff paid can be generated in excel or similar to allow an export to happen. This provides all stakeholders with confidence that the core process will always be maintained. This is quite different to changing your accounting system, where once you cut over there really is no going back.

**Retrospective Configuration**

As long as time is being recorded there are very few settings or configurations that can’t retrospectively be changed. This means that as issues appear they can be corrected. This ranges from pay period to overtime rules, to allowances. This means that draft settings can be created, and then corrected during the initial clock in period.

## Why Agile?

We've established that you _can_ use agile for WFM implementation. Here's why you _should_.

**Discover and Learn at small scale**

We haven’t yet worked out how to predict the future. In a waterfall project, we would do ask surveys, fill out detailed project requirements, risk matrices. The issue is while it’s all theoretical, we won’t really know what the challenges are going to be.

Doing all this careful planning also takes up a lot of time, effort and cost. It also makes people reluctant to adjust and change. With Agile you can start much sooner with a very small sample size. Then review the results, improve processes and move onto the next step.

**Deliver Value Sooner**

We also start generating value for the organization straight away, often times the easy wins can make up a large % of the total business value that will be delivered. Going from a paper system to a digital system is a huge step up, even before all modules have been adopted.

**Quantitative Measure of Progress**

There is an adage in project managers, that projects are going well until they are not. In waterfall projects it's hard to measure success until you are far down the path, at which point it's expensive to make changes. This is why many projects continue on to a (delayed, over-budget) completion even when everyone in the project knows it's a bad idea. With agile, you can grade how well the project is going - basically in real time - so you can give project sponsors the positive news other projects don't.

**Considerable Reduce Risk**

It’s a pretty fundamental belief to not put all your eggs in on basket, but this is exactly how most software projects are done. 6 months of planning, configuring and testing all heading towards on go-live date where it gets turned on.

It’s like preparing for a rocket launch, where every step must be meticulously checked and double-checked because the slightest error could bring the whole thing down. 1000’s of the smartest people on the planet at Nasa work for months and unfortunately even they get it wrong sometimes.

The fact of the matter is there, is no need to turn a Workforce management implementation into a rocket launch and doing a lot of little launches along the whole course of the project is actually a much safer way of doing it.

## What’s the hardest part for executives & project managers about agile?

**Things can feel fast and rash**

  
**There isn’t a specific detailed plan with a lot of due dates. Where is my Gantt Chart?**

Agile replaces due dates with sprints and backlogs. These serve the same process of allowing the project team to report to executives on the progress, just in a much more accurate and evidence-based way. Think about the contriviredness of specific due dates that are 9months away. It’s all guesswork, and not really something you should be relying on.

Instead of asking people when something can be done by. Agile asks the people doing the work, how hard they think something is going be, relative to all the other things there are to do. It then tracks how quickly things are getting done each week, and assumes that

**Lawyers hate agile**

Agile is built on an element of trust. Lawyers are hired to basically remove this from relationships. This does mean a fair bit of back and forth will be required to get this balance right. In most cases, I have seen this end with suppliers accepting more risk and trusting that the client’s commercial people will hold their word, rather than the contracts.

**There are about 10 new words, none of which make much sense.**

Sprints, Scrums, retrospective, backlogs what is all this new fangled management speak. It’s true there is a lexicon of language to learn, but it does serve a purpose. The ideas from agile are a paradigm shift, and while plenty of people work in agile ways without them, it’s very helpful to have a common language to describe the idea. Keep an eye out for a future post on this.
